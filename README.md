# flightboard-ui

## Overview

A UI to display flightboards for aircraft from my flightboard-api project. The GUI is pretty basic, and is rendered with NiceGUI. I can't be asked to learn JavaScript at this point. :)

## Setup

Modify the URL to point to your running instance of flightboard-api and then run the script with uv `uv run src/main.py`

I will be dockerizing this at some point to have both components running in a docker-compose file. For now, it can be run manually.
